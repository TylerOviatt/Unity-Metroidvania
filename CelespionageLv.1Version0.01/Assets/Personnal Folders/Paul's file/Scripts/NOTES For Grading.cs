   // I had made the character jump animate, along with then sprint and idle.
   // I had also added the transition to fade to black upon starting the game and starting the level. 
   // I had also created the menu to properly pause and restart. The only one i didnt get to was sound
   //functionality. However, hopefully the extra credit can help in that regard. Sorry
   // It was late, I wanted to turn in the best of what I can do and properly learn it 
   //instead of giving you a rushed product. Thank you.
